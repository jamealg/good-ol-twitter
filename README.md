# Good ol Twitter
See only your followers' tweets. No likes. No retweets.

Tested (somewhat) in Chrome 71 and in Firefox 63.

## Roadmap
- Test further in Safari, Edge, etc.
- Decrease time between page load and hiding tweets
- Filter certain words or phrases
- Exclude half of all tweets to weed out the unlucky ones

## Changelog
- 0.0.3 - Hide tweets by default. Add option to make tweets revealable in browser action pop-up
- 0.0.2 - Instead of hiding likes/retweets they are obscured with the option to reveal them
- 0.0.1 â€“ Initial
